# eIF3 PAR-CLIP analysis
These codes is to analyze eIF PAR-CLIP clusters within LINE1. Initial library was generated by Cate Lab [1]. 

## Snakefile
To preprocess raw sequencing data and map the processed sequences to L1Hs sequence.  
Instructions for the programs that used in Snakefile can be found in "instructions.md". 

## eIF_PAR-CLIP_analysis.ipynb
To analyze PAR-CLIP clusters within LINE1 sequence, particularly from 5' UTR and m6A-mapped sites.
