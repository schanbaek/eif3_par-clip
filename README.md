# eIF3 PAR-CLIP analysis
These codes is to analyze eIF PAR-CLIP clusters within LINE1. Initial library was generated by Lee, Kranzusch and Cate [1]. 

## Snakefile
This Snakefile is generated for preprocessing of raw sequencing data and map the processed sequences to L1Hs sequence.  
Snakefile pipelines multiple commands automatically. It can be downloaded from https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ with detailed manuals.  
Instructions for the programs that used in Snakefile can be found in "instructions.md". 

## eIF_PAR-CLIP_analysis.ipynb
Snakefile ends up with the bam file as final output.  
This jupyter notebook codes analyze PAR-CLIP clusters within LINE1 sequence, particularly from 5' UTR and m6A-mapped sites by using the bam files. Jupyter notebook can be installed from https://jupyter.org/.
